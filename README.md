## ðŸ§  Overview

**Imagine your organization just onboarded 12 new AWS accounts under a multi-account structure.** You're tasked with ensuring every environment continuously enforces compliance baselines such as no publicly accessible S3 buckets, secure security group configurations, and no disabled CloudTrail logs. Manually tracking and remediating these issues isn't scalable.

This lab simulates a real-world scenario where your GRC/security team codifies compliance guardrails using AWS Config and EventBridge, then automatically remediates violations using AWS Lambda. This is a foundational step toward achieving "compliance as code" across cloud environments.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:

- Understand how AWS Config rules detect compliance violations
- Learn how EventBridge captures compliance state change events
- Implement auto-remediation via AWS Lambda functions
- Link actions to compliance frameworks (e.g., NIST 800-53, CIS v8)
- Build audit-ready controls with logs and structured findings

---

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

Before starting:

- AWS Account with admin-level permissions (or IAM roles that allow Config, Lambda, EventBridge, and S3 operations)
- AWS CLI configured locally
- Basic familiarity with:
  - AWS Config rules (managed + custom)
  - Lambda function creation and permissions
  - CloudFormation (optional if deploying via template)
